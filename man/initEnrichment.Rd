\arguments{
\item{scmatrix}{A numeric matrix of n metabolites (rows) and m cells or measurments (columns).}

\item{conditions}{A vector of length m with condition identifiers.}

\item{enrichment_type}{A character specifying whether Overrepresentation analysis (ORA) or Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) is performed}

\item{annotations}{An optional custom list of length n, with each element contains a vector of isomer names. If not specified,
bmetenrichr uses the CoreMetabolome, LIPIDMAPS, SwissLipids, and HMDB databases from METASPACE (https://metaspace2020.eu/) to generate an annotation list automatically.}

\item{annotation.weights}{An optional list of length n, each element contains a vector of isomer weights. Only when annotations is provided as list.}

\item{consider_isomers}{A logical indicating whether to include isomers (default = TRUE)}

\item{consider_isobars}{A logical indicating whether to include isobars (default = FALSE)}

\item{mass_range_ppm}{A numeric indicating the mass range in ppm (default: mass_range_ppm = 3). Molecular formulas + adducts within this range will be treated as isobars. Only required when isobars = TRUE.}

\item{polarization_mode}{A character with either 'positive' (default) or 'negative'. Only required when isobars = TRUE. When set to 'positive', included adducts are '+H', '+Na', and '+K'.
When set to 'negative', included adducts are '-H', '+Cl'.}

\item{include}{An optional logical vector of length n indicating whether to include the annotations in the analysis.}

\item{molecule_type}{A character specifying the feature type for the enrichment background, either Metabolites or Lipids. Valid choices are c("Metabo", "Lipid").}

\item{background_type}{A character specifying the background type for enrichment, choose one from c("LION","main_class","super_class","sub_class","pathways").}

\item{custom_bg}{A named list with character vectors of metabolite names. Default is NULL}

\item{termsOfInterest}{A character containing 'selection' (for default LION-term selection), 'all', or a vector of term names (see 'pathway').}

\item{condition.x}{first condition identifier for pairwise comparison.}

\item{condition.y}{second condition identifier for pairwise comparison.}

\item{ranking.by}{A character of either 't.test' or 'wilcox.test', to rank metabolites for the respective statistic.Ignored if \link{enrichment_type} is 'ORA'.}

\item{gsea.method}{A character of either 'ks_signed' or 'fgsea'. Ignored if \link{enrichment_type} is 'ORA'.}
